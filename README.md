# MultipleLinearRegression

This is a practice project of using  Multiple Regression model with multiple features to predict performance index of students.

## Libraries

- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- pandas
- sklearn

## Steps

1. **Taking Care Missing Data**:  Replace missing data for all features by mean and most_frequent strategy.
1. **Split Dataset**: Split the dataset into two sets - a training set (80%) and a test set (20%).
2. **Train Model**: Use the `LinearRegression` class from the `sklearn` library to train the model using the training set data.
3. **Predict Student Performance**: After training the model, use it to predict students'performance index by using the test set data.
4. **Saving Data**: Saving data as .csv file.


## Example of prediction value and actual value
